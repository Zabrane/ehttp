Introduction
------------

This is a library application for OTP, suitable to handle HTTP
requests and responses. It includes functions suitable to
manipulate headers and cookies.

This was very much done for fun, and to experiment a little bit
more with erlang while learning it, so I dont recommend you
(still) to use it in a production environment.

Please send your comments to marcelog@gmail.com, I'll be glad
to improve and/or correct things!
